# Web-Based-Tracking-RADAR-Trajectory-Simulator
The project reads data from ECEF, ENV, or LLA coordinate datasets and converts it to Range, Theta, and Phi for real-time simulation of crucial RADAR parameters. It displays the Azimuth Angle, Elevation Angle, and Range in three separate graphs and transmits the data to a receiver PC.
